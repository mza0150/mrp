# MRP.py 
### A Parameterizer of Post-Translationally Modified Residues
This code was developed by Patrick Sahrmann in the Goodwin research group at Auburn University. 

This program is designed to streamline the process of modified residue parameterization.
MRP.py is designed to work with AmberTools and the Gaussian software package to handle molecular 
modeling and QM calculations, respectively. AmberTools15 or higher should be used in conjuction with this program
